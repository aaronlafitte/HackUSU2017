Secret Santa - USU 2017 Hackathon

 -----------
 
  -  We were very excited to build this app because we feel that most charity and donation events remove the personal contact many people would like as they give of their time and money. 
  -  This app provides a way for anyone to have more involvement in what their money is used for and how it blesses specific individuals lives.

  This was a Flutter project, based on Reddit Secret Santa. Flutter is a new framework that is still in Alpha and utilizes the language Dart. Flutter allows simplified cross product development and easy access to firebase. This app works on both Ios and Android platforms. We found a wishlist from the Road Home in Salt Lake City on Amazon and we pulled that into our app to create a list for users to view and have a more personal touch as they donate to those in need.
  Our goal was for the users to see the effect that their donations had. We implemented this in a few places. One, with the Amazon wishlist, users can track their gift from the moment it ships until the moment it arrives at the shelter. Two, the home page of the app contains a list of past events and shows how previous donations affected individuals lives. To go a step further, recepients would have the option of sending picture of them with their gift, to the donor as a personal thank you for the donor's generosity.
  The settings page of the app offers the ability for those in need, or someone who knows someone in need, to get in contact with a local shelter and receive help.
